It spends a portion of its two-year life cycle on Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana). The pathogen’s spores develop in late fall on the juniper as a reddish brown gall on young branches of the trees.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren’t too many of them.

        <br/>2. While the spores can travel for miles, most of the ones that could infect your tree are within a few hundred feet.

        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/>Gray leaf spot lesions on corn leaves hinder photosynthetic activity, reducing carbohydrates allocated towards grain fill. The extent to which gray leaf spot damages crop yields can be estimated based on the extent to which leaves are infected relative to grainfill. Damage can be more severe when developing lesions progress past the ear leaf around pollination time.	Because a decrease in functioning leaf area limits photosynthates dedicated towards grainfill, the plant might mobilize more carbohydrates from the stalk to fill kernels.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. In order to best prevent and manage corn grey leaf spot, the overall approach is to reduce the rate of disease growth and expansion.

        <br/>2. This is done by limiting the amount of secondary disease cycles and protecting leaf area from damage until after corn grain formation.

        <br/><br/>Common corn rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi, is the most frequently occurring of the two primary rust diseases of corn in the U.S., but it rarely causes significant yield losses in Ohio field (dent) corn. Occasionally field corn, particularly in the southern half of the state, does become severely affected when weather conditions favor the development and spread of rust fungus

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Although rust is frequently found on corn in Ohio, very rarely has there been a need for fungicide applications. This is due to the fact that there are highly resistant field corn hybrids available and most possess some degree of resistance.

        <br/>2. However, popcorn and sweet corn can be quite susceptible. In seasons where considerable rust is present on the lower leaves prior to silking and the weather is unseasonably cool and wet, an early fungicide application may be necessary for effective disease control. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Management of NCLB can be achieved primarily by using hybrids with resistance, but because resistance may not be complete or may fail, it is advantageous to utilize an integrated approach with different cropping practices and fungicides.

    'Grape___Black_rot': """ <b>Crop</b>: Grape <br/>Disease: Black Rot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring.

        <br/> 2. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. 

        <br/> 3. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.

        <br/>2. Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.
        
        <br/>3. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.

The overwintering structures that produce spores (perithecia or pycnidia, depending on the pathogen) are embedded in diseased woody parts of vines.

        <br/> 3. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are released and wounds made by dormant pruning provide infection sites.

        <br/> 4. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning with susceptibility declining over time.


        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Post-infection practices (sanitation and vine surgery) for use in diseased, mature vineyards are not as effective and are far more costly than adopting preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and applications of pruning-wound protectants) in young vineyards. 


        <br/>2. Sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it.
        
        <br/>3. The fungicides labeled as pruning-wound protectants, consider using alternative materials, such as a wound sealant with 5 percent boric acid in acrylic paint (Tech-Gro B-Lock), which is effective against Eutypa dieback and Esca, or an essential oil (Safecoat VitiSeal).""",

    'Pepper,_bell___Bacterial_spot': """ <b>Crop</b>: Pepper <br/>Disease: Bacterial Spot<br/>
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Bacterial spot is caused by several species of gram-negative bacteria in the genus Xanthomonas.

        <br/> 2. In culture, these bacteria produce yellow, mucoid colonies. A "mass" of bacteria can be observed oozing from a lesion by making a cross-sectional cut through a leaf lesion, placing the tissue in a droplet of water, placing a cover-slip over the sample, and examining it with a microscope (~200X)..
        
        
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. The primary management strategy of bacterial spot begins with use of certified pathogen-free seed and disease-free transplants.

        <br/>2. The bacteria do not survive well once host material has decayed, so crop rotation is recommended. Once the bacteria are introduced into a field or greenhouse, the disease is very difficult to control.
        
        <br/>3. Pepper plants are routinely sprayed with copper-containing bactericides to maintain a "protective" cover on the foliage and fruit.

        <br/>1. Plant only diseasefree, certified seed. 

        <br/>2. Follow a complete and regular foliar fungicide spray program.
        
        <br/>3. Practice good killing techniques to lessen tuber infections.

    'Potato___Late_blight': """ <b>Crop</b>: Potato <br/>Disease: Late Blight<br/>

        Late blight is a potentially devastating disease of potato, infecting leaves, stems and fruits of plants. The disease spreads quickly in fields and can result in total crop failure if untreated. Late blight of potato was responsible for the Irish potato famine of the late 1840s.              
        <br/> Cause of disease:

        <br/><br/> 1. Late blight is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. Oomycetes are fungus-like organisms also called water molds, but they are not true fungi.

        <br/> 2. There are many different strains of P. infestans. These are called clonal lineages and designated by a number code (i.e. US-23). Many clonal lineages affect both tomato and potato, but some lineages are specific to one host or the other.
        <br/> 3. The host range is typically limited to potato and tomato, but hairy nightshade (Solanum physalifolium) is a closely related weed that can readily become infected and may contribute to disease spread. Under ideal conditions, such as a greenhouse, petunia also may become infected.
        
        
        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Seed infection is unlikely on commercially prepared tomato seed or on saved seed that has been thoroughly dried.

        <br/>2. Inspect tomato transplants for late blight symptoms prior to purchase and/or planting, as tomato transplants shipped from southern regions may be infected
        
        <br/>3. If infection is found in only a few plants within a field, infected plants should be removed, disced-under, killed with herbicide or flame-killed to avoid spreading through the entire field.

        <br/> 2. In warm, dry conditions, new spores form and easily spread the disease.
        <br/> 3. Symptoms of powdery mildew first appear mid to late summer in Minnesota.  The older leaves are more susceptible and powdery mildew will infect them first.
        <br/> 4. Wind blows spores produced in leaf spots to infect other leaves.
        <br/> 5. Under favorable conditions, powdery mildew can spread very rapidly, often covering all of the leaves.

        <br/><br/> How to prevent/cure the disease <br/>
        <br/>1. Apply fertilizer based on soil test results. Avoid over-applying nitrogen.

        <br/>2. Provide good air movement around plants through proper spacing, staking of plants and weed control.
        
        <br/>3. Once a week, examine five mature leaves for powdery mildew infection. In large plantings, repeat at 10 different locations in the field.
        <br/>4. If susceptible varieties are growing in an area where powdery mildew has resulted in yield loss in the past, fungicide may be necessary.
